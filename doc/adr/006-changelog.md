# 006. Changelog and semantic versionning

Date: 2020-10-21

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As soon as a project is not a simple propotype that will be quickly thrown away, the memory of why things were done as they are will fade much more quickly than you expected.

Either for the coder itself or for any other future user or contributor, to see precisely what changes have been made will be of great help.

Moreover you should be able to link any change to a release of the code.

## Decision

Use practices largely adopted through open source projects.

Here: [Conventional Commits 1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/#semantic-versioning-200).

Choose tools helping to manage commits and releases.

## Consequences

Contributors must use those tools.
