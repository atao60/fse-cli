# 002. Keep working with npm, not yarn

Date: 2020-10-20

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Two of the most popular package managers among JavaScript (and Node.js) developers are [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/). There seems to be a lot of similarities between these two package managersâ€”since Yarn drew a lot of inspiration from npm, and now npm seems to be drawing inspiration from Yarn. However, there are subtle differences between them, which can make you prefer one over the other. 

See e.g. [NPM vs. Yarn: Which Package Manager Should You Choose?](https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/free-developer-tools/blog/npm-vs-yarn-which-should-you-choose/), August 12th, 2020 by Guy Bar-Gil

## Decision

Stay with npm:
- no need of any yarn specificity
- don't afraid any potential contributor

## Consequences

None
