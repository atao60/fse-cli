üèó  File system extra CLI - Usage

üèÅ Each command is available:
    * either as a stand alone one, e.g. `fse-copy` or `fse-cli-copy`,
    * or as a sub command, e.g. `fse copy` or `fse-cli copy`.

üéπ When launching a job, by default each argument without default or inline value will be prompted. 
To force prompting for all the arguments, add the option '--all' when available.
To suppress output when it makes sens (i.e. not an error or an output of query command), use either the option '--quiet'
or the environment variable 'FSE_CLI_QUIET=true'.

    * version          Displays [@atao60/fse-cli](https://github.com/atao60/fse-cli/releases) version (and [Node.js: fs-extra](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) version).

        `fse version`

    * help             Displays the present manual.

        `fse help`

    * copy             Copies a file or directory. The directory can have contents. Like 'cp -r'.
                       Note. `--keepExisting` behaves as the opposite of `fs-extra`'s `--overwrite`.

        `fse copy --all --keepExisting --dereference --errorOnExist --preserveTimestamps --quiet <source path> <destination path>`
                       
    * mkdirp           Ensures that the directory exists. If the directory structure does not exist, it is created. Like 'mkdir -p'.
                       Aliases: ***ensureDir***, ***mkdirs***, ***mkdirp***

        `fse mkdirp --all --mode <integer> --quiet <new directory's path>`

    * emptyDir          Ensures that a directory is empty. Deletes directory contents if the directory is not empty. 
                        If the directory does not exist, it is created. The directory itself is not deleted.

        `fse emptyDir --quiet <directory's path>`

    * remove            Removes a file or directory. The directory can have contents. If the path does not exist, silently does nothing. Like rm -rf.
                        Aliases: ***remove***, ***rimraf***

        `fse remove --quiet <directory's path>`

    * touch             Ensures that the file exists. If the file that is requested to be created is in directories that do not exist, 
                        these directories are created. If the file already exists, it is NOT MODIFIED.
                        Aliases: ***ensureFile***, ***touch***

        `fse touch --quiet <new file's path>`

    * move              Moves a file or directory, even across devices.

        `fse move --all --overwrite --quiet <source path> <destination path>`
