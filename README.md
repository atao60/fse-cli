<span style="font-size:3em;">üèó</span>A cli for [fs-extra](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra). 

## üí° Rational

Everyone needs simple file system operations like copy, remove, clean, ... that can be used from the terminal or via scripts. 

While there are many [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) packages that provide this, all are meant to be used as part of an application, and does not have a CLI.

This CLI is based on [Node.js: fs-extra](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra). 

The [available CLI commands](#-commands) are fully functional and tested. However it's still a work in progress:
* Not all [fs-extra](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra) functions are mapped yet. Please, feel free to open an issue if there is something you would like supported.
* More tests to come, even if they will only concern the CLI part without overlapping [fs-extra](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra)'s tests.

## üèÅ Quickstart

Add this package to a project:

```
npm install @atao60/fse-cli
```

Each function is available:
- either as a stand alone one, eg `fse-copy`,
- or as a sub command, eg `fse copy`.

The arguments are those of [Node.js: fs-extra](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra) as far as possible.

For more details, see the [manual](MANUAL.md).

## üéπ Commands

- [copy](MANUAL.md#'copy-file-or-directory'),
- [ensureDir](MANUAL.md#'creating-directories'), alias *mkdirs* or *mkdirp*
- [remove](MANUAL.md#'deleting-directories'), alias *rimraf*
- [emptyDir](MANUAL.md#'Cleaning-directories'),
- [ensureFile](MANUAL.md#'creating-files'), alias *touch*,
- [move](MANUAL.md#'move-file-or-directory').

Indeed [Node.js: fs-extra](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra).

Furthermore [node-fs-extra-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fs-extra-cli) was very useful to start this project.
