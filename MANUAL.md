# üèó  File system extra CLI - Manual

## üèÅ Quickstart

Each command is available:
- either as a stand alone one, e.g. `fse-copy` or `fse-cli-copy`,
- or as a sub command, e.g. `fse copy` or `fse-cli copy`.

The options and arguments are the same as those of [Node.js: fs-extra](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fs-extra) unless otherwise stated.

## üéπ Commands

When launching a job with prompting, by default the user is asked the arguments for which there is no default or inline value. 
To force prompting for all the arguments, add the option '--all'.

### Copy file or directory

From the [fs-extra documentation](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/blob/master/docs/copy.md):

"Copy a file or directory. The directory can have contents. Like cp -r."

*Follow the prompts*

```
fse copy
```

*Power user style*

```
fse copy --all --keepExisting --errorOnExist --dereference --preserveTimestamps <source path> <destination path>
```

> Note. `--keepExisting` behaves as the opposite of `fs-extra`'s `--overwrite`.

### Creating directories

"Ensures that the directory exists. If the directory structure does not exist, it is created. Like mkdir -p."

```

### Deleting files and directories

From the [fs-extra documentation](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/blob/master/docs/remove.md):
